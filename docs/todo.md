todo:
- fix the negative text-indent in Figma
    - For the sake of speed, Im going to add this as part of caveats.. with comments, most likely, designers wont use small width sizes, but if it is the case, then they could potentially add the indentations themselves then
- fix the spacing in verse numbers
- fix frame naming convention
- add reference at the bottom of the frame
